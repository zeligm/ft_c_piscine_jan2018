# 42_piscine_jan18
I did my piscine on january 2018, in the Fremont, California campus of École 42. Here is the daily workload, weekend projects -rushes &amp; solo- and exam questions (lvl 0, 1, 2 &amp; 3). To future pisciners who may find and use this code:

-Everything is Normed.
-Almost everything passes Stupidity (if you don't know what Stupidity is while you are doing your piscine and intend to beat Moulinette, do yourself a favor, google it and USE IT.
-Don't use my header if you don't want your code flagged, nobody likes a -42 as a grade.
-LEARN the goddamn code, don't just copy/paste it. In 42, even if you didn't wrote the code, if you know it by heart and can reproduce the code from scratch, you'll be able to pass.
-Regarding the exam question base, you are supposed to be able to code it without help/internet, so study it.
-C is love & segfaults are nature's garbage collection.

I hope you learn a lot in your piscine, be able to pass it, make some new good friends & if you get shitty rush team mates, don't sweat it and keep working.

P.s. If you are thinking about giving up in your piscine, don't.

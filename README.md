# ft_c_piscine_jan2018
I finished my piscine on january 2018, in the Fremont, California campus of Ã‰cole 42. Here is the daily workload, weekend projects -rushes &amp; solo- and exam questions (lvl 0, 1, 2 &amp; 3). To future pisciners who may find and use this code:

-Code this on your own, your skill as a coder will thank you for it.

-Regarding the exam question base, you are supposed to be able to code it without help/internet, so study it.

-C is love & segfaults are nature's garbage collection.


I hope you learn a lot in your piscine, be able to pass it, make some new good friends & if you get shitty rush team mates, don't sweat it and keep working.

P.s. If you are thinking about giving up in your piscine, don't.
